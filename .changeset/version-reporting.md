Each client now identifies itself as `yungle-cli/<version>`, `yungle-mcp/<version>` or `yungle-client/<version>` in `User-Agent`. `yungle-client` accepts a `userAgent` option. The CLI has `yungle --version`. The MCP server reports its real version during the handshake; before this it always said 0.1.0.
