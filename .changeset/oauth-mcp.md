`yungle login` signs you in from the browser; there's no key to copy, and it works over SSH. The session refreshes itself, including during long uploads. `yungle logout` revokes it. The MCP server gains `create_share_link`, which shares content you pass it as a link without emailing anyone, and `share_local_files`, which does the same for files on disk (local server only; hidden files are refused). It also gains `send_transfer`, which only exists when the credential may send email; every send asks the user to confirm, and a client that can't ask gets the link instead. `yungle mcp install --allow-write` accepts a key with `transfers:write`. The MCP package now exports `createServer` for running it over HTTP. `yungle-client` reports `via` and `canEmail` on `me().key`.
